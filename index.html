    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I am a product designer with 7 years of experience in UX/UI design for apps and websites, including user research, interaction design, visual design, and UX writing.</p>
        <p>From 2017-2022, I was the co-founder of an ed-tech startup that built a language-learning app called Lingua Franca. As the founding designer, I created concepts, wireframes, and high-fidelity designs for the app using tools such as Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. This work resulted in 5 different activity types organized as lessons within 10 levels.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am the product designer for the Fit Body App, and I have been involved in the development of a new dashboard from scratch, as well as the addition of new workout programs, new trainers, and UI updates to current On Demand programs. As the sole designer on this small team, I have become adept at creating and iterating on a product under the pressure of working within a short time span.</p> 
        <p>Other notable projects include prototyping a landing page and product pages for Vitalura Labs, a supplement company, and Novos Intelectuais, an educational endeavor.</p>
        <p>I am currently learning motion design with the intent of widening my skillset and facilitating work and communication within this area.</p>
